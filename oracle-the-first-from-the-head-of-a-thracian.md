Oracle the First From the Head of a Thracian
============================================

The recent completion of a short silver surfer course at the Library here and I am cyber-tooled-up to interface the world.

I shall now launch my poly-blog with some directions!

First, take your smartphone or similar device, with this blog post upon it, and in the manner of Syd (to be explained), 
walk to Cambridge or get there by some modern means of transportation. On Trumpington Street you will find the Fitzwilliam 
Museum. I usually like to walk in the deep immemorial mega-gutters that they have on this street, to avoid the pavements 
crammed with tour parties and such. The gutters are actually big enough for a lie down on a dry day if such an affectation 
should take your fancy. Once you resume your walk, go through the Fitzwilliam Museum main entrance, whence the stone 
lions loiter (the lions of stone like to stroll down to the Trumpington Street gutters for a drink at night-time, so 
they say), turn right and go down the steps to ‘Greece and Rome’. Once you reach ‘Greece and Rome’ you will find a 
glass case containing a painted Greek stemless cup (kylix).

Oracle the First will issue from this, object Ant.103.25.

It may take you some time to find the object, as there are a lot of painted wine cups, mixing bowls and jugs, encased 
in their timelessly contemporary vitrines. When you find the cup, please concentrate your gaze on the severed head 
floating between the two intact figures painted upon it, and on the head’s painted mouth. Then ask it a question, any 
question, as long as you hope the answer to it will help you to face life itself. On your phone-device, press the Play 
arrow on the audio file below. The mouth, if you look closely enough, and if you go along with my playful fancy, will 
then utter its oraculations, which will make their way through your headphones into your head.

You have now heard the words of Oracle the First, and in the rest of this post I will attempt to interpret the oracular 
utterance as best I can.

The main subject of the oracle’s river-borne floating voice seems to be the legendary singer and musician Orpheus, who
 is indeed, according to the museum label, the head on the cup.

‘The birds, lamenting, cried for you, Orpheus’!

Jane Ellen Harrison is one of my heroes. The Cambridge Classical HEAD and feminist pioneer. The first woman in England 
to become a professional academic, who practically invented the methods we now take for granted for the study of Greek 
mythology. A friend of mine called Beetle, of whom you will hear more, introduced me to Harrison in 1968. Beetle loaned 
me her library copy of Harrison’s modestly styled tome ‘Prolegomena to the Study of Greek Religion’ (a prolegomena is 
merely a prologue, a brief introduction). In it Harrison describes the very wine cup you are standing before, and the 
various tales of Orpheus that inform it. Of the story of lyrical-lyrist Orpheus, Harrison writes:

> Conon…devotes to Orpheus the whole of one of his narrations. He tells all the orthodox details, how Orpheus \[of Thrace\] 
won the hearts of Thracians and Macedonians by his music, how he charmed rocks and trees and wild beasts and even the heart 
of Kore, queen of the underworld. Orpheus refused to reveal his mysteries to women, whom since the loss of his own wife he 
had hated en masse.

Orpheus has the songs, the ability to travel to the realms of the spirits: could Orpheus originally have been a southern 
shaman? He was certainly a talented artist. According to Soviet anthropologist GM Vasilevic, the people who were most 
likely to become Siberian shamans ‘were very sensitive, had a sharp memory and a vivid imagination and were able to relate 
the events of their life in an artistic way. From this class the most talented tale-tellers and song improvisers emerged…’

Conon says that women followers of Dionysos then ripped Orpheus the lyre-man to pieces because of his rejection of their 
god in favour of Apollo – it has to be remembered that these legends emerged, Jane Harrison states, out of a female 
denigrating society, which could account for some of the themes. Other sources talk of Orpheus’ spurning of women as 
the initiation of homosexuality. But the women may also have been followers of Dionysos, whose religion they thought 
singer-songwriter Orpheus, follower of sun-god Apollo, was threatening: ‘And they tore \[Orpheus\] to pieces and cast his 
limbs asunder \[note that these words were in the oracle you heard\]. But the Muses gathered them together and buried 
them in the place called Leibethra.’ (Eratosthenes.)

As you gazed upon the wine cup in front of you, and as you stood in the museum room, with its air of peace timeless and 
its beautiful fragments seeming to hover on glass shelves within their sparkling crystal voids, did you Muse on the 
manifold forms of VIOLENCE BARBAROUS that saturated every last one of the artefacts around you like the fetid stink of a 
corpse? Indeed it is one of Harrison’s achievements that she revealed the ancients as dwellers not only in a Golden Age 
of gilded beauty and creativity, but also as perpetrators and victims of a Crimson Age of frenzied and irrational brutality. 
BLOODY JANE was her nickname.

Conon describes one version of the Orpheus story, which accounts for the painting of the levitating head on the cup:

> ‘After some search the head was found by a fisherman at the mouth of the River Meles.’ It was still singing nor had it 
suffered any change from the sea, nor any other of the outrages that the Keres \[female death spirits\], which beset 
mortals, inflict on the dead, but it was still blooming and even then after the long lapse of time it was bleeding with 
fresh blood \[…\] When the miraculous head, singing and bleeding, was found, they took it and buried it beneath a great 
monument and fenced it in with a sacred precinct, a precinct that no woman might ever enter.

‘Conon has undoubtedly put his finger on the truth,’ Harrison writes. ‘Orpheus was a real man, a mighty singer, a prophet 
and a teacher, bringing with him a new religion, seeking to reform an old one. He was martyred and after his death his tomb 
became a mantic shrine.’

A number of years ago, as I was first embarking on my journey of self-improvement, I stared at the daintily painted 
severed head and Muse’d on this: is it possible to gather artefacts within museums and without – like the Muses with 
their bloody baskets full of dripping limbs – into a _body of knowledge_, into a Story-Vision for our own age?

I saw my ever-truehearted Sparrow this morning. When he had stopped frolicking with his wren-mates on the elderberry by 
the graveyard entrance, he skittishly and lightly alighted on a buddleia near the path to tell me: ‘Philostratos. He 
relates another version of the head’s story. The head of Orpheus’ story. A different version. To the one you said you 
would put in your blog: “After the outrage of the women the head of Orpheus reached Lesbos and dwelt in a cleft of the 
island and gave oracles in the hollow earth.” Hence the figure, a youth, to the left. He sits to the left of the head. 
On the wine cup. He takes down the head’s oracles with his stilus and tablets.’

Like the youth, I had to quickly note down what Sparrow had to say (on the back of a flyer advertising a talk on Egyptian 
death rituals at the library). Sparrow needed to have a little swoop-around, as is a bird’s want, before he returned to 
the purple bush.

‘The figure. To the right.’ Sparrow continued, ‘To the right side of the floating head on the cup. It is Apollo. The sun
god. Gesturing ambivalently. He is vetoing the oracle as unwelcome competition. Because Apollo was another version of 
Orpheus. Mythically speaking. Apollo was the god of music who taught Orpheus to play his golden lyre and was the usual
sponsor and source of oracles. Or it could be that Apollo is giving his blessing. To Orpheus his follower. To the cheeky 
enterprise of Orpheus in muscling in on his territory. It could be either. By all means use that Emma. For your first 
post. By all means. Have to run…’

And off he flew over the great avenue of Limes that lead from the cemetery up to Mill Road. As Sparrow says, the painted 
Apollo’s gesture and facial expression are hard to read either way, I think you will agree.

An oracle in the ancient world, such as that at Delphi, was effectively a female shaman communing with spirits in an 
ecstatic trance state, generating oblique poetic utterances. So folk-saint Orpheus was a shaman even in death. Though 
the modern Siberian shamans talk of possession, of the spirits whispering into their ears to tell them the words of the 
Vision-Songs of their journeys, their performance requires the skills of a Muse inspired storyteller. The rite has to 
remain creative; to continually transform itself with each shaman and with each improvised ritual, to stay alive.

So there you have my first post, my first stab at fleshing out one of our oracle’s cryptic and partial pronouncements 
with an expanded discourse. I will leave you with these fragments: according to the Kabbalah, God’s attributes were once 
held in vessels whose glass was contaminated by evil and which had consequently shattered, scattering their contents to 
the four corners of the earth. Tikkun was the name for the process of collecting and piecing the fragments together. Can 
we, each one of us, gather a corporeality of objects – not a literal collection of things but a _story_ of them – and 
could we gather a body of artefacts that are, so to speak, _still bleeding_? WHAT KIND OF STORY WOULD THAT BE?

_In my second post on Friday I will muse on the southern shaman who reformed his savage god and gained immortality. 
Could the shaman provide a new dissent for now, waking the beast?_
